# Introduction
Two files with each haivng a different functionality, GaussianBlur.java adds a gaussian blur to images using the Kernel matrix and the GrayScaleConvert.java converts a given image to grayscale equivalents.

These are proof of concepts I have for a simple photo-editing software I am working on built using Java

# How to use
It's not really user friendly, you will have to provide the path to the photo in the arguements of each of the Java file, running it with an IDE will do the rest.
